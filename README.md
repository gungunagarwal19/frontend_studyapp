# Learnmate

Learnmate is a personal project designed to revolutionize how you organize, study, and interact with your learning materials. With Learnmate, you can create custom sections, upload files, generate flashcards, enable spaced repetition, and even ask questions about your content—all in one place.

## Features

### 1. Section-Based Organization
- **Create Sections:** Organize your content by creating unique sections (e.g., Math, History, Programming).
- **Upload Files:** Upload files (PDFs, docs, etc.) to any section at any time for flexible organization.

### 2. Smart PDF Info Extraction
- **PDF Parsing:** When you upload a PDF to a section, Learnmate extracts and summarizes key information.
- **Pinecone Integration:** All extracted info is saved to Pinecone for efficient semantic search and retrieval within each section.

### 3. Flashcard Generation
- **Automated Flashcards:** Flashcards are automatically generated from the content of files uploaded to each section.
- **Continuous Updates:** As more files are added, the flashcard set grows and evolves.

### 4. Spaced Repetition
- **Intelligent Review:** Flashcards support spaced repetition, helping you review material at optimal intervals to boost retention.

### 5. Ask Section
- **Question & Answer:** Each section has an "Ask" feature where you can ask questions about the uploaded files.
- **Contextual Answers:** Responses are generated based on the content stored in Pinecone, ensuring accurate and relevant answers.

## How It Works

1. **Create a Section:** Start by making a new section for your subject or topic.
2. **Upload Files:** Add PDFs or other files relevant to your section.
3. **Info Extraction:** Learnmate parses and stores summary info from PDFs in Pinecone for semantic search.
4. **Flashcard Generation:** Flashcards are created from the contents of your files, and you can begin practicing them.
5. **Spaced Repetition:** Review flashcards using spaced repetition algorithms for effective learning.
6. **Ask Questions:** Use the Ask feature to query information about your uploaded files and get instant, content-based answers.

## Example Workflow

1. **Create section:** "Biology"
2. **Upload PDFs:** Add lecture notes, textbook chapters, or research papers.
3. **Flashcards:** Learnmate automatically creates flashcards like "What is mitosis?" from your files.
4. **Spaced repetition:** Practice daily for long-term retention.
5. **Ask:** "Explain the process of cellular respiration." Get an answer based on your uploaded PDFs.
